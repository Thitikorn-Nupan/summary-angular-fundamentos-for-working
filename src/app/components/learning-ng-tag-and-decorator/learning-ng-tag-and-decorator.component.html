<!--
    ## <ng-template> element defines a template that is not rendered by default.
    One of the main uses for <ng-template> is to hold template content that will be used by Structural directives.
    Those directives can add and remove copies of the template content based on their own logic.
    ** Use Cases of Ng-template
    Reusable components
    Conditional rendering
    Dynamic content
    Customizing Components
    ##
    ng-template is always used along with structural derivatives such as ngIf, nfFor, and ngSwitch.
    It is used for grouping content that is not rendered, but that can be used in other parts of your code.
